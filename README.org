SegAnnDB: interactive genomic segmentation

[[file:HOCKING-interactive-genomic-segmentation.pdf][Slides]] that explain the novelty of the SegAnnDB system:
- The first system which allows the user to interactively add/update
  breakpoint and copy number labels on scatterplots of DNA copy number
  data.
- How to predict the breakpoint locations when there is more than one
  maximum likelihood segmentation model which is consistent with the
  labels for the current data set?  [[http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/hocking13.html][A max-margin interval regression
  algorithm is used to learn a penalty function using all the labeled
  data sets]]. Importantly, the model gets more accurate as you label
  more data sets.
- How to determine breakpoint locations when there are no maximum
  likelihood segmentation models which are consistent with the labels
  for the current data set? [[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00759129][The SegAnnot constrained segmentation
  model is used to find the most likely breakpoints which are
  consistent with the labels]].
